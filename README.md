# Variance and Trajectory of Collective Performance Advancements across Track and Field Disciplines

**Abstract:** If you want to learn about StackEdit, you can read me. If you want to play with Markdown, you can edit me. Once you have finished with me, you can create new files by opening on the left corner of the navigation bar.


## 1. Introduction

StackEdit stores your files in your browser, which means all your files are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

## 2. Related Works

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## 3. Dataset Information

Brief introduction to the dataset.

### 3.1 Background

Detailed introduction to the data sources, why it was collected, and why they were chosen for this project.

### 3.2 Collection

Describe how the data was taken from the sources into the final use for this project.

### 3.3 Limitations

Overview the limitations of the data sources, why the limitations exist, and possible complications that may arise from those limitations. (Weather, missing/incorrect data, unofficial results, etc)

## 4. Data Curation & Preparation

Detailed description of what data was used for the project (describe all rows/columns)


## 5. Model Building

Brief introduction to the ML model and the process of building one.

### 5.1 Model Selection

Detailed description of what model was chosen and why

### 5.2 Model Training

Explain the training process, data split for training/testing sets, and possible
retraining

### 5.3 Model Performance & Evaluation

Explain the performance of the model, if it is viable to use in production, or if
adjustments must be made.

## 6. Results

Brief introduction to the results of the model(s)

### 6.1 Model Forecast

Detailed look at where the model(s) say each discipline will project to.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis

Detailed look at how the historical progression differs among disciplines.

## 7. Discussion

(IF NEEDED) Brief detail of additional discussion topics not included in previous or future sections.

### 7.1 Variance Across Disciplines

(IF NEEDED) Dive into the details of if there are differences in the progression
of each discipline, and why that may be the case

### 7.2 Similarities Across Disciplines

(IF NEEDED) Dive into the details of if there are similarities in the progression
of each discipline, and why that may be the case

## 8. Challenges

Identify the obstacles faced during the process, including challenges the model
faces and challenges in analyzing the results

## 9. Conclusion

Come to a final stance on the main points outlined at the beginning, using the
results from this study as the evidence for such a claim

## 10. Future Work

Determine what the next possible steps will be in researching this topic. (Larger
