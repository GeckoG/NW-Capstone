## 3. Dataset Information

Brief introduction to the dataset.

### 3.1 Background

Detailed introduction to the data sources, why it was collected, and why they were chosen for this project.

### 3.2 Collection

Describe how the data was taken from the sources into the final use for this project.

### 3.3 Limitations

Overview the limitations of the data sources, why the limitations exist, and possible complications that may arise from those limitations. (Weather, missing/incorrect data, unofficial results, etc)

## 4. Data Curation & Preparation

Detailed description of what data was used for the project (describe all rows/columns)


## 5. Model Building

Brief introduction to the ML model and the process of building one.

### 5.1 Model Selection

Detailed description of what model was chosen and why

### 5.2 Model Training

Explain the training process, data split for training/testing sets, and possible
retraining

| Gradient Boosting Regression | 31.0387 | 16.5701   | 0.9823  |

### 5.3 Model Performance & Evaluation

Explain the performance of the model, if it is viable to use in production, or if
adjustments must be made.

## 6. Results

Brief introduction to the results of the model(s)

### 6.1 Model Forecast

Detailed look at where the model(s) say each discipline will project to.

### 6.2 Comparative Analysis

Detailed look at how the historical progression differs among disciplines.

## 7. Discussion

(IF NEEDED) Brief detail of additional discussion topics not included in previous or future sections.

### 7.1 Variance Across Disciplines

(IF NEEDED) Dive into the details of if there are differences in the progression
of each discipline, and why that may be the case

### 7.2 Similarities Across Disciplines

(IF NEEDED) Dive into the details of if there are similarities in the progression
of each discipline, and why that may be the case

## 8. Challenges

Identify the obstacles faced during the process, including challenges the model
faces and challenges in analyzing the results

## 9. Conclusion

Come to a final stance on the main points outlined at the beginning, using the
results from this study as the evidence for such a claim

## 10. Future Work

Determine what the next possible steps will be in researching this topic. (Larger
sample size, different approach, narrower/broader scope, etc.)
